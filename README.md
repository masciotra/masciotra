Jonathan Masciotra

I am a second year Mechanical Engineering student at Concordia currently taking part in the Institute of Cooperative Education (Co-op)
Here you will find my current and completed projects that will show you that I put all my effort into anything I work on, wether it be in Space Concordia,
or personal projects, I strive to produce the best quality possible.

Enjoy :)
